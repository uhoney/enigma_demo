Notes for project:

Reflector:
    - Simple swap of char based on chosen UKW

Rotor:
    - If rotor2 has its turnover at 'X' and current rotor2 index is at 'X', rotor3 will unlock after the next keypress and spin.
    It will spin EVEN if rotor2 does not spin.
    - So rotor1 spins every single time, and spins rotor2 if rotor1's index is at a turnover

Plugboard:
    - Simple one-to-one swap of characters if they are connected
    (A=B, B=A, or C=C if not connected)


Steps:
    - Keypress (rotor 1 spins, current starts to flow)
    - Plugboard (swaps if connected)
    - Rotor 1 (swaps)
    - Rotor 2 (swaps)
    - Rotor 3 (swaps)
    - Reflector (swaps)
    - Rotor 3 reversed (swaps)
    - Rotor 2 reversed (swaps)
    - Rotor 1 reversed (swaps)
    - Plugboard (swaps if connected)
    - Light turns on
